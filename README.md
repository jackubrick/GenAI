# Research and Retrieval Bot

#### This Streamlit Application aims to enable comprehensive online research on a variety of tasks, as well as automating the Retrieval process in RAG.

This project aims to streamline manual research, providing reliable, comprehensive, and unbiased reports. Unlike default llm chatbots, this Research and Retrieval Bot aims to avoid outdated information and hallucinations, ensuring well-rounded answers for any research topic you provide it producing a consolidated Research Article. All documents the Bot uses to inform its research will be cached and persisted to a vector database, which can be queried against using the RAG chatbot, allowing users to ask more in-depth questions on the topics researched.
